Hi, I’m Aryan. I’m a graduate student in Computer Science at [Columbia
University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in New York City.

At Columbia, I’m working with Prof. [Lydia
Chilton](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/lydia-chilton)
and the [Computational Design Lab](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/), where
I’m exploring human-centered, agentic productivity tools with a focus on
transparency and preserving user agency when people work with AI.

I’m also exploring vision-language models and GUI testing agents with Prof.
[Zhuo Zhang](https://zzhang.xyz/) to help uncover risky or malicious UI flows in
mobile applications.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/).
While there, I was a TA for CMSC 250 (Discrete Structures) with Prof. [Justin
Wyss-Gallifent](https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/) (Principal Lecturer) and
Prof. [Clifford Bakalian](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/cyb) (Lecturer), and I
worked with Prof. [Vlassis Mastrantonis](https://math.cornell.edu/vlassis-mastrantonis)
(H.C. Wang Assistant Professor at Cornell University) through the [Directed
Reading Program](https://drp.math.umd.edu/) on a talk about Brouwer’s Fixed
Point Theorem ([slides](http://drp.math.umd.edu/Project-Slides/KaulSpring2021.pdf)).

Previously, I was a software engineer at Amazon working on Kindle’s mobile
applications. I shipped features, improved reliability through crash and ANR
triage, and added monitoring for key product health metrics, alongside leading
work to make the reading experience more accessible for users with disabilities,
including contributions to a design system built from the ground up. At Dell
Technologies, I aggregated telemetry across programs and enabled real-time
reporting by integrating live Jira data into Confluence dashboards.

I’m grateful to my professors for their support throughout my journey, including
Prof. Wyss-Gallifent, Prof. Mastrantonis, and Prof. [Michael
Hicks](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/michael-hicks/) (Cecilia Fitler Moore
Professor at the University of Pennsylvania).
