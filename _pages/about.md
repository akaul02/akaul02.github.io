Hi, I’m currently studying Computer Science at [Columbia
University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in New York City.

At Columbia, I’m working with Prof. [Lydia
Chilton](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/lydia-chilton)
and the [Computational Design Lab](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/), where
I’m exploring human-centered, agentic productivity tools with a focus on
transparency and preserving user agency when working with AI. I’m also working
with Prof. [Zhuo Zhang](https://zzhang.xyz/) on vision-language models and GUI
testing agents to help uncover risky or malicious UI flows in mobile
applications.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/).
While there, I was a TA for CMSC 250 (Discrete Structures) with Prof. [Justin
Wyss-Gallifent](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/immortal) (Principal Lecturer) and
Prof. [Clifford Bakalian](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/cyb) (Lecturer), and I
worked with Prof. [Vlassis Mastrantonis](https://vmastr.github.io/) (H.C. Wang
Assistant Professor at Cornell University) through the [Directed Reading
Program on a talk about Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem
[slides](http://drp.math.umd.edu/Project-Slides/KaulSpring2021.pdf).

Previously, I was a software engineer at Amazon working on [Kindle mobile
applications](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-app-guide). I
shipped features, improved reliability through crash/ANR triage,
added monitoring for key health metrics, led accessibility improvements, and
contributed to a design system built from the ground up. At Dell, I consolidated
cross-program reporting and built real-time dashboards for executives.

I’m grateful to my professors for their support throughout my journey, including
Prof. Wyss-Gallifent, Prof. Mastrantonis, and Prof. [Michael
Hicks](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/michael-hicks/) (Cecilia Fitler Moore
Professor at the University of Pennsylvania).
