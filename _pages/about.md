Hi! I’m currently studying Computer Science at [Columbia
University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in New York City.

At Columbia, I work with Prof. [Lydia
Chilton](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/) and the [Computational Design
Lab](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/chilton.html) on human-centered,
agentic productivity tools, with a focus on transparency and preserving user
agency when working with AI. I also work with Prof. [Zhuo
Zhang](https://zzhang.xyz/) on vision-language models and GUI testing agents to
help uncover risky or deceptive UI flows in mobile applications.

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/).
While there, I was a TA for CMSC 250 (Discrete Structures) with Prof. [Justin
Wyss-Gallifent](https://math.umd.edu/directory/profile/jwyg) (Principal Lecturer)
and Prof. [Clifford Bakalian](https://bakalian.cs.umd.edu/) (Lecturer). I also
gave a talk in the Department of Mathematics on fixed-point theorems and
continuity, mentored by Prof. [Vlassis Mastrantonis](https://vmastr.github.io/)
(Assistant Professor, Cornell University).

Previously, I was a software engineer at Amazon working on improving the
digital reading experience on [Kindle](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-app-guide).
I also spent a summer at Dell, where I consolidated cross-program reporting and
built real-time dashboards for executives.

I’m grateful to my professors for their continued support throughout my journey,
including Prof. Wyss-Gallifent, Prof. Mastrantonis, and Prof. [Michael
Hicks](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhna/) (Professor, University of
Pennsylvania). I’m also grateful to [James
Haager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimhaager/) and [Gregor
Kaplan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregor-kaplan-2429141/)—my first managers—for
their guidance, support, and recommendations.
